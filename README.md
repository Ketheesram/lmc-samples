# Sort Three Numbers in Assembly (LMC Style)

This is a simple program written in LMC-style assembly language that:
- Takes three inputs from the user
- Sorts them in ascending order
- Halts when the values are sorted

## Instructions
This program expects three inputs and will compare/swap them if necessary to sort them.

It uses basic LMC instructions like `INP`, `STA`, `LDA`, `SUB`, and conditional branching.

## Memory Labels
- `A`, `B`, `C`: Store the input values
- `TEM`: Temporary storage used during swaps

## How to Run
Use an LMC simulator (like [this one online](https://peterhigginson.co.uk/lmc/)) and paste the code to run it.
